# ReFuse: Generating Imperviousness maps from Multispectral Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery

In this repository, we walk through the creation of a highly available, scalable and distributed inference data pipeline to generate imperviousness maps through Deep-Learning applied to Sentinel-2 satellite images.  
The approach can be easily extended to every use case, which needs fast and scalable elaboration on satellite images. 
In the end, you will be able to deploy your data pipeline in the cloud or test it in your local workstation.
